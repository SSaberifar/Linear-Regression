Linear Regression Implementation

Overview
This project implements a linear regression model from scratch using Python. The aim is to provide an understanding of how linear regression works under the hood without relying on libraries like scikit-learn for the implementation of the model itself.

Dataset
This project uses the California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets, featuring data from the 1990 census to predict median house values.

Features
Learning Rate Decay: The learning rate decreases over time to ensure convergence.
Gradient Descent: Implements the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the linear regression model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used as the loss function to evaluate the model's performance.

Usage
To use the Linear Regression model, import the LinearRegression class from the Linearregression.py file in your project. Create an instance of the class, train it using your data with the fit method, and then make predictions on new data using the predict method.
